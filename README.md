# Text-To-Math-Problem-Solver-Using-Google-Gemma2-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files of "Text To Math Problem Solver Using Google Gemma2 Project", an GenAI Project

(i) Developed an end-to-end Gen AI application that solves text-based math problems and provides step-by-step explanations using Google Gemma2 and LangChain.

(ii) Built a Streamlit interface with sidebar input for the Groq API key and a chat-based interface for entering math queries.

(iii) Integrated LangChain tools including LLM Math Chain for calculations, Wikipedia search for contextual data, and reasoning chains for logical problem solving.

(iv) Created a modular agent system combining multiple tools, allowing the model to answer arithmetic, algebra, and logic-based math questions interactively.

(v) Implemented session state management in Streamlit to maintain conversation history and display responses sequentially for clear understanding.

(vi) Delivered a fully functional, scalable, and interactive math assistant capable of parsing real-world word problems, performing calculations, and providing concise, step-by-step answers.
